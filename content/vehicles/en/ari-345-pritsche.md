description: The ARI 345 Pikcup is a three-wheeled delivery moped with an open
  driver's cab and a tiltable pickup bed. The vehicle body is available in three
  sizes with a loading length of up to 1.55 meters and around 1.8 m² loading
  area. The vehicle can already be driven with a moped driving license in many
  countries. As a pickup with 325 kg cargo load, the ARI 345 is particularly
  suitable for inner-city use by delivery services, landscaping companies and
  construction companies. Practical accessories such as a lattice box or a
  tarpaulin structure are available for the loading platform.
